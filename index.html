                      Color consistency is crucial to developing robust deep learning methods for histopathological image analysis. With the increasing use of digital histopathological images, the deep learning methods are likely developed based on the data from multiple medical centers. This requirement makes it a challenge task to normalize the color variance of histopathological images from different medical centers. In this paper, we proposed a novel color standardization module named stain standardization capsule (SSC) based on the paradigm of capsules network and the corresponding dynamic routing algorithm. The proposed module can learn and generate uniform stain separation outputs for histopathological images in various color appearance without the reference to manually selected template images. The SSC module is light and can be trained end-to-end with the application-driven CNN model. The proposed method was validated on two public datasets and compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results have demonstrated that the SSC module is effective in color normalization for histopathological images and achieves the best performance in the compared methods.

                      Cervical cell classification is of important clinical significance in the screening of cervical cancer at early stages. In this paper, we present a novel cervical cell clas-sification method based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). In contrast with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) which can classify cervical cells through learned deep features, the proposed method uses GCN to explore the im-age-level potential relationship for improving the classification performance. Spe-cifically, each cervical cell image is represented by a pre-trained CNN. k-means clustering is performed on these CNN features and then the graph structure is constructed where each node is characterized by one cluster centroid. Conse-quently, the image-level relationship can be captured in terms of intrinsic cluster-ing structure. GCN is applied to propagate the underlying correlation of nodes and the relation-aware representation of GCN is incorporated to enrich the image-level CNN features. Experiments on the cervical cell image datasets demonstrate the excellent superiority of our method.

                        The research on content-based histopathological image retrieval (CBHIR) has become popular in recent years. CBHIR systems provide auxiliary diagnosis information for pathologists by searching for and returning regions that are contently similar to the region of interest (ROI) from a pre-established database. To retrieve diagnostically relevant regions from a database that consists of histopathological whole slide images (WSIs) for query ROIs is challenging and yet significant for clinical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel CBHIR framework for regions retrieval from WSI-database based on hierarchical graph neural networks (GNNs). Compared to the present CBHIR framework, the structural information of WSI is preserved by the proposed model, which makes the retrieval framework more sensitive to regions that are similar in tissue distribution. Moreover, benefited from the hierarchical GNN structures, the proposed framework is scalable for both the size and shape variation of ROIs. It allows the pathologist defining the query region using free curves. Thirdly, the retrieval is achieved by binary codes and hashing methods, which makes it very efficient and thereby adequate for practical large-scale WSI-database. The proposed method is validated on a lung cancer dataset and compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method achieved precisions above 82.4% in the irregular region retrieval task, which are superior to the state-of-the-art methods. The average time of retrieval is 0.514 ms.

In this paper, we designed two deep learning structures based on a fully convolutional network (FCN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN), to achieve the segmentation of carcinoma regions from WSIs. FCN is developed for segmentation problems and CNN focuses on classification. We designed experiments to compare the performances of the two methods. The results demonstrated that CNN performs as well as FCN when applied to WSIs in high resolution. Furthermore, to leverage the advantages of CNN and FCN, we integrate the two methods to obtain a complete framework for lung cancer segmentation. The proposed methods were evaluated on the ACDC-LungHP dataset. The final dice coefficient for cancerous region segmentation is 0.770.

                        <b>Background and objective</b><br>
                        Color consistency of histological images is significant for developing reliable computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems. However, the color appearance of digital histological images varies across different specimen preparations, staining, and scanning situations. This variability affects the diagnosis and decreases the accuracy of CAD approaches. It is important and challenging to develop effective color normalization methods for digital histological images.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Methods</b><br>
                        We proposed a novel adaptive color deconvolution (ACD) algorithm for stain separation and color normalization of hematoxylin-eosin-stained whole slide images (WSIs). To avoid artifacts and reduce the failure rate of normalization, multiple prior knowledges of staining are considered and embedded in the ACD model. To improve the capacity of color normalization for various WSIs, an integrated optimization is designed to simultaneously estimate the parameters of the stain separation and color normalization. The solving of ACD model and application of the proposed method involves only pixel-wise operation, which makes it very efficient and applicable to WSIs.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Results</b><br>
                        The proposed method was evaluated on four WSI-datasets including breast, lung and cervix cancers and was compared with 6 state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method achieved the most consistent performance in color normalization according to the quantitative metrics. Through a qualitative assessment for 500 WSIs, the failure rate of normalization was 0.4% and the structure and color artifacts were effectively avoided. Applied to CAD methods, the area under receiver operating characteristic curve for cancer image classification was improved from 0.842 to 0.914. The average time of solving the ACD model is 2.97 s.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Conclusions</b><br>
                        The proposed ACD model has prone effective for color normalization of hematoxylin-eosin-stained WSIs in various color appearances. The model is robust and can be applied to WSIs containing different lesions. The proposed model can be efficiently solved and is effective to improve the performance of cancer image recognition, which is adequate for developing automatic CAD programs and systems based on WSIs.</p>

                    Histopathological image classification (HIC) and content-based histopathological image retrieval (CBHIR) are two promising applications for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis. HIC can efficiently predict the type of lesion involved in a histopathological image. In general, HIC can aid pathologists in locating high-risk cancer regions from a WSI by providing a cancerous probability map for the WSI. In contrast, CBHIR was developed to allow searches for regions with similar content for a region of interest (ROI) from a database consisting of historical cases. Sets of cases with similar content are accessible to pathologists, which can provide more valuable references for diagnosis. A drawback of the recent CBHIR framework is that a query ROI needs to be manually selected from a WSI. An automatic CBHIR approach for a WSI-wise analysis needs to be developed. In this paper, we propose a novel aided-diagnosis framework of breast cancer using whole slide images, which shares the advantages of both HIC and CBHIR. In our framework, CBHIR is automatically processed throughout the WSI, based on which a probability map regarding the malignancy of breast tumors is calculated. Through the probability map, the malignant regions in WSIs can be easily recognized. Furthermore, the retrieval results corresponding to each sub-region of the WSIs are recorded during the automatic analysis and are available to pathologists during their diagnosis. Our method was validated on fully annotated WSI datasets of breast tumors. The experimental results certify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

                      <b>Background and objective</b><br>
                      Content-based image retrieval is an effective method for histopathological image analysis. However, given a database of huge whole slide images (WSIs), acquiring appropriate region-of-interests (ROIs) for training is significant and difficult. Moreover, histopathological images can only be annotated by pathologists, resulting in the lack of labeling information. Therefore, it is an important and challenging task to generate ROIs from WSI and retrieve image with few labels.
                      <br><br>
                      <b>Methods</b><br>
                      This paper presents a novel unsupervised region proposing method for histopathological WSI based on Selective Search. Specifically, the WSI is over-segmented into regions which are hierarchically merged until the WSI becomes a single region. Nucleus-oriented similarity measures for region mergence and Nucleus–Cytoplasm color space for histopathological image are specially defined to generate accurate region proposals. Additionally, we propose a new semi-supervised hashing method for image retrieval. The semantic features of images are extracted with Latent Dirichlet Allocation and transformed into binary hashing codes with Supervised Hashing.
                      <br><br>
                      <b>Results</b><br>
                      The methods are tested on a large-scale multi-class database of breast histopathological WSIs. The results demonstrate that for one WSI, our region proposing method can generate 7.3 thousand contoured regions which fit well with 95.8% of the ROIs annotated by pathologists. The proposed hashing method can retrieve a query image among 136 thousand images in 0.29 s and reach precision of 91% with only 10% of images labeled.
                      <br><br>
                      <b>Conclusions</b><br>
                      The unsupervised region proposing method can generate regions as predictions of lesions in histopathological WSI. The region proposals can also serve as the training samples to train machine-learning models for image retrieval. The proposed hashing method can achieve fast and precise image retrieval with small amount of labels. Furthermore, the proposed methods can be potentially applied in online computer-aided-diagnosis systems.

                    Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has been widely researched for histopathological images. It is challenging to retrieve contently similar regions from histopathological whole slide images (WSIs) for regions of interest (ROIs) in different size. In this paper, we propose a novel CBIR framework for database that consists of WSIs and size-scalable query ROIs. Each WSI in the database is encoded into a matrix of binary codes. When retrieving, a group of region proposals that have similar size with the query ROI are firstly located in the database through an efficient table-lookup approach. Then, these regions are ranked by a designed multi-binary-code-based similarity measurement. Finally, the top relevant regions and their locations in the WSIs as well as the corresponding diagnostic information are returned to assist pathologists. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated on a fine-annotated WSI database of epithelial breast tumors. The experimental results have proved that the proposed framework is effective for retrieval from database that consists of WSIs. Specifically, for query ROIs of 4096$\times$4096 pixels, the retrieval precision of the top 20 return has reached 96\% and the retrieval time is less than 1.5 second.

                    Feature extraction is a crucial and challenging aspect in the computer-aided diagnosis of breast cancer with histopathological images. In recent years, many machine learning methods have been introduced to extract features from histopathological images. In this study, a novel nucleus-guided feature extraction framework based on convolutional neural network is proposed for histopathological images. The nuclei are first detected from images, and then used to train a designed convolutional neural network with three hierarchy structures. Through the trained network, image-level features including the pattern and spatial distribution of the nuclei are extracted. The proposed features are evaluated through the classification experiment on a histopathological image database of breast lesions. The experimental results show that the extracted features effectively represent histopathological images, and the proposed framework achieves a better classification performance for breast lesions than the compared state-of-the-art methods.

                    In the field of pathological image analysis based on machine learning, the generation of appropriate training data set is significant but difficult. As a solution, this paper addresses a novel unsupervised region proposal method for histopathological whole slide image based on Selective Search. Specifically, the method utilizes multiple magnifications, modifies the similarity measure for grouping regions and proposes a new Nucleus-Cytoplasm color space to gain more region proposals. Additionally, a new retrieval acceleration method based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Supervised Hashing is raised. The experiments on a large-scale multi-class database of breast histopathological images demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our methods.

                Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has been widely researched for medical images. In application of histo- pathological images, there are two issues that need to be carefully considered. The one is that the digital slide is stored in a spatially continuous image with a size of more than 10K x 10K pixels. The other is that the size of query image varies in a large range according to different diagnostic conditions. It is a challenging work to retrieve the eligible regions for the query image from the database that consists of whole slide images (WSIs). In this paper, we proposed a CBIR framework for the WSI database and size-scalable query images. Each WSI in the database is encoded and stored in a matrix of binary codes. When retrieving, the query image is first encoded into a set of binary codes and analyzed to pre-choose a set of regions from database using hashing method. Then a multi-binary-code-based similarity measurement based on hamming distance is designed to rank proposal regions. Finally, the top relevant regions and their locations in the WSIs along with the diagnostic information are returned to assist pathologists in diagnoses. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated in a fine-annotated WSIs database of epithelial breast tumors. The experimental results show that proposed framework is both effective and efficiency for content-based whole slide image retrieval.

                      In the field of pathology, whole slide image (WSI) has become the major carrier of visual and diagnostic information. Content-based image retrieval among WSIs can aid the diagnosis of an unknown pathological image by finding its similar regions in WSIs with diagnostic information. However, the huge size and complex content of WSI pose several challenges for retrieval. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised, accurate, and fast retrieval method for a breast histopathological image. Specifically, the method presents a local statistical feature of nuclei for morphology and distribution of nuclei, and employs the Gabor feature to describe the texture information. The latent Dirichlet allocation model is utilized for high-level semantic mining. Locality-sensitive hashing is used to speed up the search. Experiments on a WSI database with more than 8000 images from 15 types of breast histopathology demonstrate that our method achieves about 0.9 retrieval precision as well as promising efficiency. Based on the proposed framework, we are developing a search engine for an online digital slide browsing and retrieval platform, which can be applied in computer-aided diagnosis, pathology education, and WSI archiving and management.

                    Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) for digital pathology slides is of clinical use for breast cancer aided diagnosis. One of the largest challenges in CBIR is feature extraction. In this paper, we propose a novel pathology image retrieval method for breast cancer, which aims to characterize the pathology image content through texture and pathological features and further discover the latent high-level semantics. Specifically, the proposed method utilizes block Gabor features to describe the texture structure, and simultaneously designs nucleus-based pathological features to describe morphological characteristics of nuclei. Based on these two kinds of local feature descriptors, two codebooks are built to learn the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) models. Consequently, each image is represented by the topics of pLSA models which can reveal the semantic concepts. Experimental results on the digital pathology image database for breast cancer demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method.

                    Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is widely used in Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems which can aid pathologist to make reasonable decision by querying the slides with diagnostic information from the digital pathology slide database. In this paper, we propose a novel pathology image retrieval method for breast cancer. It firstly applies block Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features to describe the spatial texture property of pathology image, and then use them to construct the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) model which generally takes advantage of visual words to mine the topic-level representation of image and thus reveals the high-level semantics. Different from conventional pLSA model, we employ low-rank and sparse matrix composition for describing the correlated and specific characteristics of visual words. Therefore, the more discriminative topic-level representation corresponding to each pathology image can be obtained. Experimental results on the digital pathology image database for breast cancer demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method.
